Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
=========================================
Scope
-----
In this project, the main purpose is building a data schema and from that we can query to find out the answers for the questions like where immigrants choose to live or visit and the population in these places.

The data sets are used in this project:
	I94 Immigration Data
	U.S. City Demographic Data

The project will be run locally on workspace and Spark will be used to pre-process and do ETL.
